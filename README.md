## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I intentionally avoided the use of Flexbox or Grid. I want to get a good understanding on how positioning in a website works. And I must admit that there are a few topics I struggled with.

Specially aligning author's picture and name. I struggled to understand where to apply the display property (parent? item? every item inside the parent?) and then I spend a lot of time researching until I found the vertical-align property.

I'm aware that the code lacks of responsiveness but I'm still getting my head around viewport sizes and rem values.
